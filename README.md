# discord-bot-template

A simple template for a [Discord] bot using [discord.py],
providing the essential tooling and basic building blocks
for writing your own custom Discord bot in minutes,
with minimal bells and whistles attached.

The template includes two "hello world"-style commands as a demonstration.
Use these as a basis for adding new commands for your own special bot.

Further, the [documentation](https://griceturrble.github.io/discord-bot-template/)
serves as a guide for newcomers to understand all the inner workings of a Discord bot,
some best-practice patterns to follow,
and links to pertinent documentation on discord.py itself.

ðŸš€ Happy botting!
