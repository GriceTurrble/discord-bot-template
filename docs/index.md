# Discord bot template

[Use this template :material-github:](https://github.com/new?template_name=discord-bot-template&template_owner=GriceTurrble){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

A simple template for a [Discord] bot using [discord.py].

All you need to get started is:

1. Clone [the template repo](https://github.com/GriceTurrble/discord-bot-template);
2. Follow the [setup instructions](getting_started.md), adding your own Discord bot token and guild/server ID; and
3. Start the bot!

When running and installed in your server,
you get a simple bot that can respond to
a Slash Command, `/hello`:

![The test bot responding to /hello slash command](imgs/example-bot-hello.png)

...and a standard message command, `!whatsup`:

After that, you can check out
[Anatomy of a Discord Bot](explore.md)
for an in-depth explanation of how the bot works.
Use this as a guide to making your own bot that can do whatever you want!

## About this template

This is a relatively simple Discord bot that responds to just two commands.
It does not include other features that might make a bot more useful,
such as any integrations with databases, APIs, etc.
These are left as an exercise for the reader.

The template and this website are also not affiliated with either [Discord] or [discord.py].
Please use the discord.py docs as a more complete reference for this package,
and please direct any Discord-related issues to [Discord support].

## About the author

:wave: I'm [GriceTurrble](https://github.com/griceturrble),
a software developer who's been working with Python since 2014.
I am occasionally active on [Python Discord] (or "PyDis", as some call it),
where I offer advice and bad jokes to newcomers to the language
and to programming in general.

I am no expert in Discord bots or the discord.py package in particular,
but I love teaching folks new things.
I wrote this small template and its documentation from scratch,
both to expand my own knowledge about it
and, hopefully, to share those learnings with others.
